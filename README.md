### Goal ðŸŽ¯
It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. For each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.

### Story of the Dataset ðŸ“–
The Titanic was a luxury British steamship that sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912 after striking an iceberg, leading to the deaths of more than 1,500 passengers and crew. Let's take a journey on the Titanic's legacy. A fascination with disasters...

* Survival -> Did the passenger survived ?
* pclass -> Ticket class 
* sex -> Sex
* Age -> Age in years
* sibsp -> # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
* parch ->  # of parents / children aboard the Titanic
* ticket -> Ticket number
* fare -> Passenger fare
* cabin -> Cabin number
* embarked -> Port of Embarkation C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
